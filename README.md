Blender Scripts
---

My collection of random blender scripts I have made over the years, most of these pertain to working with models for VRCHAT, but I'm sure that they can be useful elsewhere

As of now only tested and known to be working on blender 2.82

Long term plans are to make this into an addon with a proper UI
